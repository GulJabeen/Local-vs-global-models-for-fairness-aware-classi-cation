The objective of this project is to detect and remove the errors to increase the quality of data. 
To partition the data into a pre-deﬁned number of clusters using K-means or K-modes then train a model
for making income level predictions using classiﬁcation algorithms. 
We have applied a global classiﬁer against clustering to improve the quality of classiﬁcation.
To design algorithms that make fair predictions which avoid disparate impact and unfair results.
Sensitive attributes must be examined like race and gender.
